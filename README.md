# Intro Node JS
## What is Node js
Node.js is a runtime for built on top of Chrome's V8. It allows you to develop apps in JavaScript outside of the browser. It's single threaded non blocking and asynchronous. This is acheived by the use of an event loop at the core of Node.js. If you know JS then you already know how to develop with Node.js. If you've never heard of Chrome's V8, it's the engine that sits inside of Chrome that actually compiles your JavaScript down to machine code. So it can be processed because JavaScript actually has to be interpreted and executed on a machine. V8 is the engine that does that.
## Instaling Node js
JavaScript and Node is also gonna be based off an event loop, which if you don't really know what that means, we'll get into it a little more but just know is that JavaScript is single threaded. As in, it's only going to be able to process work and amount of work in one little isolated instance. And then everything else kinda runs in the background. This allows Node to be able to process things much faster than a lot of other OS level languages, as long as those tasks are not CPU bound. So if you're not doing things like arithmetic or AI or machine learning, Node js is probably a perfect tool for you because it can handle things and put them in the background and continue to stay open to handle incoming requests and things like that. So that's why it's a very popular tool because it kinda allows you to scale a lot faster for smaller tasks like API's, which are like 90% of back end apps these days anyway. So that was a whole lot. Well, we're gonna cover a lot of that stuff. And like I said, here's the some of the use cases that I think are really, really good for Node js.
CLI, so a command line interface, if you've ever used Git, you've ever used anything in your terminal, your command prompt that was a command line interface. We're also gonna be covering some of that as well. So you'll be making your own CLIs build tools and automations. If you're a front end developer, you're probably familiar with something called Babel, maybe even TypeScript, Webpack, roll up. All those tools are built and executed in the Node runtime. So If you've never used Node as a front end engineer, but you've used those tools, well, you have been using Node this whole time. Because those tools execute in Node before your app actually gets deployed to the browser, that's what Node is doing.
You could pretty much do all this stuff in Node, and more, and we'll be covering a lot of it. So I'm super excited. So let's jump right in, and get started with Node js. So the first thing obviously is we need to install Node js and there are a few ways to do it. And it also depends on the machine that you're on. So for the windows folks out there if you're not running WSO or WSO2, which is a Linux environment embedded inside of windows. If you don't have that, then I do recommend going to the official Node.js installer on the nodejs.org website, where it will detect your operating system and it will allow you to download it.
### For Windows
If you're running windows and not using WSL, I recommend you use the [official instlaller](https://nodejs.org/en/) from the Node.js site. Choose the latest LTS version.
### For everyone else
If you're not on windows or you are using WSL, I recommend using installing Node.js with ```nvm``` ([node version manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)). NVM allows you to install many versions of Node.js at once and switch when you need. Also, NVM installs Node.js in a folder that will not have permission errors that you would otherwise run into with the official installer.
Once you have nvm installed, you need to install a Node version. You can download the latest LTS version with this command.
```nvm install --lts```
## Executing Node
The first thing I wanna talk about is how we can actually execute a Node program, because there's several ways, but we're really only gonna talk about the important ones. So the first one is called the Node REPL. And REPL stands for read evaluate, print, loop. It's basically an interactive shell that's gonna be in the execution context of the runtime of your choice.
### Node REPL
Before we get into creating programs and apps with Node.js, let's get a feet wet with the Node.js REPL. Just type node in your terminal. This will create a Node.js environment where we can write and execute JavaScript. You'll see that all that JS knowledge you have learned carries over to Node.js. Although, some things, specifically browser based API's probably won't work. Go ahead, try an alert('hello world') and see what happens. You'll get an error. Although the Node.js runtime uses JS as it's languge, none of the Browser based globals that you are familiar with actually exist in Node.js or they are pollyfilled to prevent runtime errors.
### File Execution
The Node REPL it nice, but you can't build an application with that. We need to be able write our code to a file and tell Node.js to execute that.
```Create a file called:index.js```
In that file, write some JS. Try out console.log('hello there'). To execute this .js file in the Node.js runtime, we can use the node command with the file name as an argument.

## Globals
Like the Browser, Node.js comes with some practical globals for us to use in our applications. So they're not gonna have this much stuff on the global in Node. But yeah, there are some globals in there that we will be talking about. So some of the ones that I wanted to mention was literally this thing called global. So if I go to Node and I say console.log(global), I mean, it's literally called global.You've probably heard of clearInterval and clearTimeout, setTimeout, setInterval. Those exists in the browser. And they work pretty much the same way here as well. Then you might see some other stuff like queueMicrotask and setImmediate, and things like that. And that has to do with kinda how the event loop works in Node.js.
### Common
```global``` Think of this as like ```window``` but for Node.js. DON'T ABUSE IT!
```__dirname``` This global is a ```String``` value that points the the directory name of the file it's used in.
```__filename``` Like ```__dirname```, it too is relative to the file it's written in. A ```String``` value that points the the file name.
```process``` A swiss army knife global. An ```Object``` that contains all the context you need about the current program being executed. Things from env vars, to what machine you're on.
```exports``` ```module``` ```require``` These globals are used for creating and exposing modules throughout your app. We'll get to modules in a second
Depending on what version on Node.js you're running, there are so many more globals. Not as many as the Browser, but enough that you'll probably never use many of them. Check them out [here](https://nodejs.org/api/globals.html).

## Moduls
There is no GUI in Node.js, no HTML or CSS. This also means there aren't any scipt tags to include JS files into our application. Node.js uses modules to to share your JavaScript with other JavaScript in your apps. No window or globals needed. If you've ever done ```window.App = window.App || {}``` then you'll like this!. A module is a reusable chunk of code that has its own context. That way modules can't interfere with or polute the global scope. You can think of them like lego blocks that you can create, import, and share. By default, Node.js uses common js modules. With newer versions of Node.js we can now take advantage of ES6 modules. To opt into using this syntax, you can use the ```.mjs``` extension instead of ```.js```. We'll be using the ES6 module syntax going forward as they are the standard now with browsers adding support now.
